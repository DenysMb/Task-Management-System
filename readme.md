# Tag Management System

## Why React over Next.JS?
I choose React because is what I have more experience with. I've been working with Vue in the last year, so it's also a way to "stay updated".

## Why Emotion over Styled-Components?
I've never worked with Emotion, only with Styled-Components, so I choose Emotion here to test this library.

## Why not use Redux, Mobx or Zustand?
Since it's a very simple application, there is no need for a complex state management.

## Why am I not using any ENUM?
There is a growing opinion in the comunity that we should avoid to use ENUMs and start to use [const assertion](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-4.html#const-assertions) if needed.
